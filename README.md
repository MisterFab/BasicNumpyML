# Machine Learning Models from Scratch with NumPy

Welcome to the repository of my machine learning experimentation. This project was inspired by the book "Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn." In this experiment, I delve deep into the core workings of several fundamental machine learning algorithms and implemented them purely using Python and NumPy.

You can download mnist_784 from https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=554&status=active. It is too large to upload to github.

## Goal

The primary purpose of this project is to understand the underlying mechanisms of machine learning models. By stripping down the algorithms to their basic principles and coding them up without the aid of high-level libraries, we can gain a deeper appreciation and understanding of their workings.

Note: This project is purely experimental and educational. The implemented models are not optimized for real-world use cases.
